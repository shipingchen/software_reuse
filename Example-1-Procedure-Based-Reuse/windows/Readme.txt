This is a simple example of reusing quick sort algorithm for Dr. Shiping Chen's book "Software Reuse".

Prerequisites:
   â€¢ Microsoft Windows OS (Linux should be also OK)
   â€¢ Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 or up

Steps to run:
   1. Reset/customize setenv.bat and cc.bat with your machine settings
   2. To set up running environment: setenv
   3. To compile and build: cc
   4. To run: Tester

If everything goes well, the program will randomly generate 10 numbers and sort them from small to big as following:
C:\Test\MyBook\Example-1-Procedure-Based-Reuse\windows>tester
2  9  6  3  4  10  6  5  2  8
2  2  3  4  5  6  6  8  9  10
